### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Adesemi Chloe Elumaro but my friends call me Dese or Semi (pronounced day-shay and shay-mee respectively).  


##### I was born in the United States but have spent the better part of my childhood living in Nigeria (the country I consider to be my beautiful home), England, and India. I am currently a junior at Duke University doing my utmost best in studying Computer Science with a minor in Economics. Professionally, I aspire to be an entrepreneur and am really interested in exploring how the intersection of technology, education, and economics can help Nigeria and other developing countries and emerging markets play a larger role in the global economy. 

##### NOW

- ✨ Working on building websites for clients
- 🧱 Building a webapp for my mom's clinic
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about **Front End Development**
